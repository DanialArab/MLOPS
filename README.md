### What is MLOps

+ MLOps is a set of best practises to put the machine learning model to production.

### Environment preparation

I set up my environemnt in my VM Ubuntu. I need to install:
+ Anaconda, for that:
        wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
        bash Anaconda3-2023.03-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
        
+ Docker
        I already installed docker engine on my machine when I took Mosh's docker course
        
+ Docker compose
